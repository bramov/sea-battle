Simple interface for the famous "Sea Battle" game

Too bored to write beatiful explanation, sorry. Maybe later.

You can check this game out by clicking the link below.

Main files: 
index.js - server on Node, also simply response to GET and POST requests.
script.js - main logic and events
gameOptions.js - game settings (not included in script.js because otherwise people could cheat by typing 'game.shot = 10000' in console)
rating.json - file that is loaded with GET and then send with POST
